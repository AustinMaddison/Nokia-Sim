This project's inital goal was just to try out **Godot 4.3**. 
I wanted to see how far I could push visual fidelity and its shader system.
Chose a classic game to reimplement, Nokia's original Snake.

    * LCD Shader
        * Substrate Parralax Shadows/Ghosting

As I was working on the project the roadmap became more ambitious. 
I hope to turn this into a faithful Nokia 3310 simulator at some point.

Future ambitions
- Abstract drawing to the LCD as pins to draw to.
- Virtual CPU, Memory, ... Hardware ...
